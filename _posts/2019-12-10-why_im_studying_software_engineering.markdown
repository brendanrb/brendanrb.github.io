There are a few reasons as to why I started the journey on becoming a software engineer. First, I'm looking to start a career that can guide me to the quality of life that I want for myself. I have also been in sales since I was 18 years old and want to be in a position that can grant me more freedom and upward movement in a way I desire. I consider myself a creative individual, and I believe software engineering can be another avenue to express myself while also building commercial skills at the same time.
