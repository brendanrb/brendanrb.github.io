I would say iterations can be considered a metaphor for life because just like in life they are able to alter current groups that we have categorized. Just like life our arrays and hashes are constantly changing and evolving. Iterators can change these for us in simple and easy to digest ways. When we grow and learn we are updating the way we percieve and handle information. So, it makes sense that transposing those same notions into code can be seen as putting our real life experiences on paper so to speak.
